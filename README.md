#  Mobile RPG Game Demo

A simple 2D mobile RPG game developed using the libGDX framework. This project was built as part of my university coursework to demonstrate foundational knowledge in game architecture, user interaction, and gameplay design.

##  Features

- 2D tile-based world rendering
- Basic player movement and interaction
- Simple enemy AI and collision detection
- UI elements including health bar and inventory menu
- Game loop and event handling
- Lightweight design for Android deployment

##  Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java  
- **Game Engine:** libGDX  
- **Development Environment:** Android Studio / IntelliJ IDEA  
- **Target Platform:** Android

##  Objectives

- Learn and implement game logic using Java
- Understand scene rendering and object-oriented design in game dev
- Deploy and test on mobile devices

##  Folder Structure

```
/core        â†’ Main game logic and rendering  
/android     â†’ Android launcher configuration
